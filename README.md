# capitalizeKata -- attempting a property-driven approach

This repo contains an attempt at a property-driven approach at the
capitalize kata, in haskell. Follow the commits to see how it went.

I used hspec to arrange my tests (as if I were doing regular TDD), but
attempted to write only relatively general properties, and no
single-point tests. Whether this is a good thing to do or not is an
open question.
